        title: Personal Statement
        type: simple
        text: >
            I am a keen, able, and versatile technologist
            with a love of Open Source software, Linux systems,
            Cloud Architecture, automation of project builds
            and infrastructure provisioning, Continuous Delivery,
            PHP, and Ruby. I like to be challenged and to learn,
            and as such spend some of my free time reading up on
            new technologies as well as advancing my knowledge of
            the existing technologies I use. I understand the
            importance of deadlines and do everything I can to make
            sure they are met, including taking my work home with me
            when needed. Whilst I was junior developer I was fortunate
            enough to have some great mentors and I remember this when
            I encounter junior developers now, passing on my knowledge
            while also giving them the tools to search out the answers
            for themselves.
